# Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts

* Setup for a weekend learning project following Buildspaces (buildspace.so)
* Playing around with some Solidity basics and using the openzeplin library for ERC 721
* FE built and deployed at https://nft-starter-project.sil3ntr.repl.co - free account goes to sleep so may not be running
* Produces a NFT with a centred 3 word combination a somewhat random combination from 3 word arrays
* NFT's in this case are SVG's encoded along with the metadata so the NFT is onchain rather than using an external server or IPFS.
* Will look to refresh the UI once I get a better grasp of react.
